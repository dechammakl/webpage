    <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of
      many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.
       The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of 
       hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its 
       predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
      a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, 
       a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll
        had to be identified by the book it contained. 
        In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called
         books or chapters or parts, are parts.

            The creation of a work of fiction implies the construction of an imaginary world. Typically, the fictionality of the work is publicly acknowledged and the audience expects the work to deviate in some ways from the real world rather than presenting only factually accurate portrayals of characters who are actual people. Because fiction is generally understood to not fully adhere to the real world, the themes and context of a work, such as if and how it relates to true issues or events, are open to interpretation.Characters and events within some fictional works may even exist in their own context entirely separate from the known physical universe: an independent fictional universe.
